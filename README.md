# E-Commerce Product Classification and Visualization üìäüõçÔ∏è

## Project Overview

The growing e-commerce industry presents a large dataset waiting to be scraped and researched upon. This dataset includes professionally shot high-resolution product images, multiple label attributes describing each product, and descriptive text that comments on the product characteristics.

## Dataset Description üìÅ

Each product is identified by an ID like `42431`. The dataset consists of the following components:
- **styles.csv**: Contains the mapping of product IDs to their attributes.
- **images/**: Contains product images, e.g., `images/42431.jpg`.

### Content of `styles.csv`:
- **id**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **gender**: Gender category (e.g., Male, Female)
- **masterCategory**: High-level product category (e.g., Apparel, Accessories)
- **subCategory**: More specific product category (e.g., Topwear, Bottomwear)
- **articleType**: Type of article (e.g., Shirt, Jeans)
- **baseColour**: Primary color of the product
- **season**: Season associated with the product (e.g., Summer, Winter)
- **usage**: Intended usage (e.g., Casual, Formal)
- **year**: Year of product release

## Data Visualization üìà

We explore the dataset and visualize various aspects using different types of plots. Below are the types of visualizations we have created and the corresponding images:

### 1. Line Plot
- **Description**: Shows the trend of fashion products over the years.

## Model Training and Evaluation ü§ñ

We implemented a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify the product images into different categories. Below is an overview of the model architecture and training process.

### Model Architecture
- **Base Model**: We used ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, as the base model. This model is known for its accuracy in image classification tasks.
- **Custom Layers**: On top of the ResNet50 base, we added a global average pooling layer, a dropout layer to prevent overfitting, and a dense layer with softmax activation for classification into multiple categories.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Image Preprocessing**: Images were resized to 60x80 pixels and normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rescaling were used to increase the diversity of the training data and help the model generalize better.

### Training Process
- **Optimizer**: We used the Adam optimizer, which is known for its efficiency in training deep neural networks.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy was used as the loss function, appropriate for multi-class classification problems.
- **Metrics**: Accuracy was tracked during training to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Epochs**: The model was trained for 15 epochs.

### Evaluation
- **Validation**: A separate validation dataset was used to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.
- **Test Accuracy**: After training, the model was evaluated on a test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization capability.

## Testing and Deployment üß™üöÄ

For testing the model, we developed a Streamlit app that allows users to upload an image and get predictions along with recommendations.

### Testing Process
- **Model Loading**: The trained model is loaded using TensorFlow.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image through the Streamlit interface.
- **Preprocessing**: The uploaded image is preprocessed to match the format expected by the model.
- **Prediction**: The model predicts the category of the uploaded image.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the predicted category, the app fetches and displays similar product images.

### Streamlit App Features
- **User Interface**: A simple and interactive UI for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Recommendations**: Displays top 5 recommended images from the predicted category.
- **Probability Display**: Shows the probability of the most similar image.

## Conclusion üìú
